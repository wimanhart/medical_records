# Medical Records Library

## Overview

The `medical_records` module is the public entry point for this repository.
It is intentionally minimal and currently does not expose any public
functions, classes, or components.

## Public API Surface

There are no public APIs in this version of the library. All functionality
will be documented here as it is introduced.

## Usage

Basic import and introspection:

```
import medical_records

help(medical_records)
dir(medical_records)
```

## Examples

Check the module docstring from a Python REPL:

```
import medical_records

print(medical_records.__doc__)
```

## Versioning and Compatibility

This repository follows semantic versioning once public APIs are introduced.
Expect breaking changes until a stable API is released.
